# In your terminal, type:

    sqlite3 test_sqlite.db


# This will open a new database file called test_sqlite.db and 
# open it in the sqlite prompt. You should see something like:

    SQLite version 3.7.12 2013-03-19 12:42:02
    Enter ".help" for instructions
    Enter SQL statements terminated with a ";"
    sqlite>

# You are now looking at the sqlite prompt.
# Let's create a database table called "Test Table": 

    sqlite> create table test_table(id);
    sqlite> .quit

# You should have created a test_sqlite.db file. Either open up the 
# directory you are working from in finder or type open . into your terminal. 
# You should see that, inside whatever directory you've been working in, 
# you have your test_sqlite.db file.

### Top-Tip: All SQL statements that you write in your terminal, inside the 
sqlite prompt, sqlite3>, must be terminated with a semi-colon ;. If you hit 
enter without adding a semi-colon to the end of your line, you will be trapped! 
Don't worry though, just add that ; on the new line and hit enter again. 
The only command that doesn't require, and in fact doesn't even work with, a ; 
is the .quit command.
