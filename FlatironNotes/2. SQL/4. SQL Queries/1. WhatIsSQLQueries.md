<!-- 
# The term "query" refers to any SQL statement that retrieves data from your database. In fact, we've already written a number of SQL queries using basic SELECT statements.
 -->

# To select all of the rows from a cats table:
SELECT * FROM cats;

# To select only rows representing data meeting certain conditions:
SELECT * FROM cats WHERE name = "Maru";

<!-- 
# What if, however, we wanted to select the oldest cat? Or all of the cats that don't currently belong to an owner? Or all of the cats with short names?

# Data storage isn't very useful if we can't manipulate, view, and analyze that data. Luckily for us, SQL is actually a powerful tool for doing just that. 
-->


# ---------------------------------------
# output the name of each column
.headers on
# now we are in column mode, enabling us to run the next two .width commands
.mode column
# adjusts and normalizes column width
.width auto
# or
# customize column width
.width NUM1, NUM2

# -------------------------
# ORDER BY

# SELECT column_name FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name ASC|DESC;
SELECT * FROM cats ORDER BY age;
<!-- # By default ORDER BY is to order in ascending order(ASC), and descending is (DESC). -->
SELECT * FROM cats ORDER BY age DESC;

# -------------------------
# LIMIT 

<!-- 
# the employee with the highest paycheck or the patient with the most recent appointment––we can use ORDER BY in conjunction with LIMIT.
# LIMIT is used to determine the number of records you want to return from a dataset.
-->
# ----- 
<!-- This part of the statement: SELECT * FROM cats ORDER BY age DESC returns all of the cats in order from oldest to youngest. Setting a LIMIT of 1 returns just the first--> 
# i.e. Oldest cat on the list
SELECT * FROM cats ORDER BY age DESC LIMIT 1;

<!-- # Let's get the TWO oldest cats: -->
SELECT * FROM cats ORDER BY age DESC LIMIT 2;

# -------------------------
# BETWEEN 
<!-- # let's say we urgently need to select all of the cats whose age is between 1 and 3. To create such a query, we can use BETWEEN. Here's an boilerplate SELECT statement using BETWEEN: -->

# SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
SELECT name FROM cats WHERE age BETWEEN 1 AND 3;

# -------------------------
# NULL 
<!-- 
# Let's say the administrator of our Pets Database has found a new cat. This kitty doesn't have a name yet, but should be added to our database right away. We can add data with missing values using the NULL keyword. 
# Let's insert our new cat into the database. Our abandoned kitty has a breed, but no name or age as of yet:
-->
INSERT INTO cats (name, age, breed) VALUES (NULL, NULL, "Tabby");

# -------------------------
# COUNT 
<!-- # SQL aggregate functions are SQL statements that retrieve minimum and maximum values from a column, sum values in a column, get the average of a column's values, or count a number of records that meet certain conditions. 

# COUNT will count the number of records that meet certain condition. Here's a standard SQL query using COUNT: -->

 # "SELECT COUNT([column name]) FROM [table name] WHERE [column name] = [value]"
SELECT COUNT(owner_id) FROM cats WHERE owner_id = 1;

# -------------------------
# GROUP BY
<!-- 
# Like its name suggests, it groups your results by a given column.

# Here, we can see at a glance that there are three tabby cats and one of every other breed — but what if we had a larger database where we couldn't just tally up the number of cats grouped by breed? That's where — you guessed it! — GROUP BY comes in handy. -->

# SELECT breed, COUNT(breed) FROM cats GROUP BY breed;

<!-- # GROUP BY is a great function for aggregating results into different segments — you can even use it on multiple columns! -->

SELECT breed, owner_id, COUNT(breed) FROM cats GROUP BY breed, owner_id;


# -------------------------
# SELECT can also be written as:
SELECT cats.name FROM cats;
# then
SELECT name FROM cats;


<!-- 
# SQLite allows us to explicitly state the tableName.columnName we want to select. This is particularly useful when we want data from two different tables.

# Imagine we have another table called dogs with a column for the dog names:
-->

CREATE TABLE dogs (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT
);

INSERT INTO dogs (name) VALUES ("Clifford");
SELECT cats.name, dogs.name FROM cats, dogs;
